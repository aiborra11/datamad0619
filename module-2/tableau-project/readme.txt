I have been always curious about telecommunication companies competitivity. Every time one of these companies called me to offer an 
interesting promotion and I felt interested, soon my current company would offer better promotion. So I am going to focus my analysis in 
what is more interesting: 

Investing to reach a big funnel to get new customers VS. investing in retaining the current users. 

Objective: To advice the company where to invest:

1. Find out the structure of the company:
    - The main activities of the company are based on mobile phone and internet services. Both report around 90% of the business model. 
    - More than 90% of the customers acquired phone service.
    - Around 80% of the customers acquired internet service. 
    - Around 65% of the customers acquired both, internet and phone services. 
    - The company has more than 7K customers in total.

2. Quantify the structure in economic terms:
    - The company generated more than 16M in total. 
    - They are mainly generated by phone and internet services: 15M. The extra 1M is generated by other services.
    - 14M/16M is generated by customers who have both: Phone and internet services. 
    - Phone users/tenure distribution is quite uniform among the 4 levels (new, regular, loyal, very loyal). But it shows strong profitability
    since total amount charged (and monthly) increases (by almost 3x) along categories. 
    *The company is having a problem with loyal mobile phone clients since the number of clients who do not use mobile phone increases
    at this step. (I would go deeper if I had more time.).
